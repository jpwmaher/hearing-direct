                        <ul>
                            <li>That people are either unaware or putting up with hearing issues for far too long</li>
                            <li>That they are in the hands of a GP (working against the backdrop of NHS austerity) as to whether they can begin their journey to better hearing</li>
                            <li>The speed, convenience, and simplicity of buying a 'one-size-fits-all' device from Hearing Direct can mitigate these two pain points for users</li>

                        <p>40% of over-50s is a huge proportion. There is a massive opportunity to tap into this demographic with more age-appropriate messaging, and dispelling the old-age connotations.</p>
                        <p>It is important that the future brand positioning of Hearing Direct is age agnositc. Our research thus far suggests this younger market are put off by the current brand execution.</p>
                        <p>More research is needed with this demographic to understand the opportunities to start the conversation with them. Thus far all our users have started with a visit to their GP.</p>
